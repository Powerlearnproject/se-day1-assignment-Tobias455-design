Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic use of engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software system. It plays various impartant roles in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems to offer solutions in various aspects of life including in communications, health sector, business and entertainment.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1960s: the establishment of software engineering
1970s: the advent of structured programming
2000s: the rise of agile methodologies

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
Design: creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
Implementation: writing codes and building software according to the design specification
Testing: conductiong various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements
Deployment: rolling out the software to the users or customers
Maintenance: providing on going support, updates and enhancement after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methods uses sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall e.g in the design, implementation while Agile methods entail iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaborative and responding to change e.g in self-organizing teams

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: responsible for writing codes and implementing software solution
Quality Assurance Engineer: ensures quality of the software by designing and executing test plans
Project Manager: oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs: are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code e.g visual studio, eclipse
VCS: software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g Git, Subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements
Tight deadlines
Technical debt
some of the strategies include effectiv ecommunication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks and regular reassement of project goals and timelines

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing: testing individual components or modules of the software
Integration testing: testing interactions between different components 
system testing: testing the entire software as a whole
acceptance testing: testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets the user needs
This testing helps identify and fix the defects early in the development for high quality software products

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
It is the crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models
prompt engineering helps avoid getting confusion in responses from AI models simply because of vague questions by making your questions clear and specific so that AI understands exactly what you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
For example if you ask 'Tell me the achievements of chemical engineering' it will give you a general answer.
But if you ask, ' Tell me the achievement of chemical engineering in nanotechnology' you will get more focused answer
